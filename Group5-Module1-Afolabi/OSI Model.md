### Task

Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

### Answer

The Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model that explains and standardizes a telecommunications or computing system's communication activities, regardless of its internal structure or technology.
The TCP/IP paradigm (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a tiered procedure similar to the OSI model in that both allow logical networking and information processing through a layered system.
In both systems, each layer serves a specific purpose. In the event of a failure, this makes locating the source of the problem easier.
By isolating any faults in the data link layer (OSI) or the hardware layer (TCP/IP) in both models, it is possible to detect if data is not being transferred properly to a hardware device. The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: Application layer, Transport layer, Network access layer, Network interface layer, and Hardware layer, whereas the OSI model consists of seven layers: Physical layer, Datalink Layer, Network Layer, Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, and Application layer. The OSI paradigm divides multiple functions into layers, but the TCP/IP model integrates them all into a single layer.
