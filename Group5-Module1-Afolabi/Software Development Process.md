### Answer

Instead of a top-down process with a single sequence of stages, the Agile SDLC emphasizes on collaborative decision-making and development over several short cycles or sprints. A cyclical development technique for software in iterations rather than all at once is the foundation of an Agile SDLC. A major project is divided into smaller cycles or sprints using the Agile SDLC.At the end of each sprint, a product emerges that can be used as a user update while maintaining the project's overall rollout. Each sprint's product serves as a way for people to provide feedback.As a result, the software's dynamics are subject to change while keeping client pleasure in mind. The sprint procedure is repeated until all items on the to-do list and those in progress have been accomplished.
